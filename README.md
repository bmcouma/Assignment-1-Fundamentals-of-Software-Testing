🧠 Mastering the AI Toolkit – Solo Project 

Welcome to my AI Toolkit Assignment – a hands-on journey through essential AI tools and frameworks. This solo project is a full-cycle demonstration of real-world AI problem-solving using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, spaCy, and Streamlit. Every notebook here contains carefully executed code, insightful answers, and practical results.

#✅ What's Covered

#🔹 Part 1: Theory and Concepts

* Explained differences between major AI libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn
* Discussed use cases, workflows, and real-world applications of Jupyter, spaCy, and others
  📌 All answers provided inside: `notebooks/part1_theory_answers.ipynb`


# 🔹 Part 2: Core Implementation Tasks

#### Task 1: Scikit-learn – Iris Classification

* Classical ML using a Decision Tree Classifier
* Included preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visual results

📍 File: `part2_task1_sklearn_iris.ipynb`


# Task 2: TensorFlow – MNIST CNN

* Built and trained a CNN to classify handwritten digits
