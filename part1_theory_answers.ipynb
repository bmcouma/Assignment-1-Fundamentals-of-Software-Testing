#Q1: TensorFlow vs PyTorch

*TensorFlow* is developed by Google and designed for production-grade applications. It uses static computation graphs and excels in mobile/web deployment using TensorFlow Lite or TensorFlow.js.

*PyTorch*, developed by Facebook, uses dynamic computation graphs (eager execution), making it more intuitive for researchers and rapid experimentation.

- *Use TensorFlow* when:
  - You want advanced deployment options.
  - You need tools like TensorBoard for visualization.

- *Use PyTorch* when:
  - You need flexibility and fast prototyping.
  - You're doing academic/research-focused tasks.

#Q2: Use Cases for Jupyter Notebooks
1. **Rapid Prototyping**: AI developers can write, test, and iterate over models interactively.

2. **Education/Reporting**: Ideal for tutorials or research as it supports code, visuals, and notes in one document.

#Q3: spaCy vs String Operations
spaCy offers tokenization, POS tagging, dependency parsing, NER, etc., while Pythonâ€™s string functions only handle raw strings. spaCy uses machine learning pipelines for more accurate and efficient NLP tasks.
